## Project setup

## Database Setup

The application automatically seeds the database with three default roles on startup:
- **viewer** - Read-only access
- **manager** - Can manage limited resources  
- **admin** - Full access to administrative features

No manual seeding is required. Just start the application and the roles will be created automatically.

For more details, see [DATABASE_SETUP.md](./DATABASE_SETUP.md)

## Email Reporting Setup (NEW!)

To enable inventory email reporting:

1. Install Redis: `choco install redis-64` (Windows) or `brew install redis` (Mac)
2. Get SendGrid API key from [SendGrid](https://app.sendgrid.com)
3. Update `.env` with your credentials
4. Start the application!

**Quick Start:** See [SETUP_EMAIL_REPORTING.md](./SETUP_EMAIL_REPORTING.md)

**Full Documentation:** See [EMAIL_REPORTING.md](./EMAIL_REPORTING.md)
